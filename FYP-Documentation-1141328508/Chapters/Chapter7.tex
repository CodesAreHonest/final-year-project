\section{Problems Encountered \& Overcoming Them}

\subsection{Acquisition of free large datasets for data processing}

The problem encountered during data gathering of this project is difficulty on finding suitable free big data from websites. It is a challenge to find problem and raise question by going into data details. It took huge amount of time to understand the focus of project and gather desired data for problem solving. 

With the help of supervisor, I had successfully obtained suitable datasets for this project. He provides guidance and helping hand to clear my doubts and confusion by suggests several website and introduce various data repositories during the meeting. 

\subsection{Goclipse plugin compile error}

Eclipse IDE could not compile and build my Go files, this is because the IDE couldn’t find GOROOT in usr/local/go. The development activities cannot proceed and face impediment on executing critical success factors. The cause of the problem is Golang compiler executable doesn't possess a copy in usr/local/go, which caused Eclipse fail to compile Go file because couldn't file the compiler. 

The problem is resolved with help of supervisors, he guides me to execute Linux command line to resolve the problem during FYP meeting. Moreover, he helps identify the root cause of problem with Google Hangout in the midnights. 

\subsection{Unclear and doubts on writing documentation}

The problem encountered during writing documentation is unclear about the purpose and objectives of each section which leads to messy and poor content deliveries in writing. A certain standard and requirement should be achieved in writing the FYP document.

The problem is resolved with the help of supervisor as he patiently guide us to arrange the content layout of document and writing citation with references.  

\subsection{Difficulty on understand concurrent programming concepts}

The problem encountered during coding process is to understand concurrent concepts. It took an enormous amount of time to implement the ideas of Goroutine and Go channel into the program to achieve concurrency with Go programming language. This is because I do not possess the experiences and knowledge to build a concurrent program.

The problem is resolved with the help of official documentation and StackOverflow websites which provide clear explanation and enlightenment for me to understand the concepts and semantics of languages. 

\subsection{Difficulty on develop PG/pgSQL scripts on data migration.}

The problem encountered during development process is writing PG/pgSQL scripts to perform data migration. The DML query requires to use \textit{insert with select} query to retrieve primary key from each entity and insert as foreign key into specific table. In addition, the query is shall possess high throughput on data processing while maintaing the data consistency and validity during the migration process. The mentioned difficulty has caused impediment on development progress and stuck for a week. 

The problem is posted on Stackoverflow forum as database question and it was discussed by various database expert with high reputation in the community. Ultimately, the issue is resolved with suggested answer provided and the query with JOIN works on my project.

\subsection{Difficulty on perform database tuning.}

The problem encountered during database tuning are listed as follow: 

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1.5ex]

	\item \textbf{Understand the risk of modification. } Modified number of maximum concurrent connection, parameter of shared memory buffer and maximum size of shared memory segment utilized by PostgreSQL database could result in database corruption and data loss. The PostgreSQL will running inconsistently and caused freezing or termination of any process if one of these value are not configure correctly. 
	
	\item \textbf{Limitation of knowledge on database system configuration.} Database tuning is an advanced techniques and incredibly difficult task perform by database administrator in mid-sized and large company to configure the database environment for situational usage. The process require deep understanding on hardware memory resources and database concepts to prevent the error on resource management between system and database. 
	
	\item \textbf{Performance bottleneck of programming langugae with database. } Each programming language utilized threads and stack differently. The maximum number of OS stacks and OS threads allow the language to utilized shall be carefully inspected and measure to prevent crash during the runtime. As an example, Go programming language only allow 1 GB of stack utilized on 64-bit system which indicates it only allow 10,000 threads (1,000,000 goroutines )to be assigned in each execution.

\end{enumerate}

The understanding is established and discovered from Go official documentation and PostgreSQL 9.5 documentation to resolve this problem. The information provided in the documentation is clear and easy to be learnt as it helps resolve all the problem mentioned. 

\subsection{Distributed Programming} 

The project objectives had been reduce to concurrent programming on data processing instead of distributed programming. 

It is possible to perform distributed programming on data processing activities in this project. However, the development required extra duration on experimentation, design and testing. Based on my current understanding and knowledge on the subject, it will require extra 3 months to develop distributed programming based program. 

\section{Execution time performance comparisons}

\subsection{Performance comparisons of Golang process PostgreSQL database}

Table G.2 in Appendix G shows the total elapsed time for Go sequential program and Go concurrent program to retrieve 300 rows of data from PostgreSQL. Real refers to actual elapsed time for the program; user and sys refer to CPU time used by process. Fmt.Println() of data retrieval is removed during the execution to obtain accurate results on program performance. It is found that concurrent programming is faster than sequential programming on process data from PostgreSQL database. 

However, the amount of CPU time spent in the kernel within the process (sys) by concurrent program is higher than sequential program. This is probably caused by utilization of hardware resources when goroutine and gochannel are communicating in the process. 

\subsection{Performance comparisons of Golang process raw CSV files}

Table F.1 in Appendix F shows the total elapsed time for Go sequential program and Go concurrent program to retrieve 300 rows from raw CSV data. Real refers to actual elapsed time for the program; user and sys refer to CPU time used by process. Fmt.Println() of data retrieval is removed during the execution to obtain accurate results on program performance. It is found that concurrent programming is faster than sequential programming on process data from raw CSV files. 

The optimization to implementations in textit{encoding/csv} has improved \cite{go1.8-changelog} and fixed slow reading problems in Go version 1.8. The build-in CSV library works blazingly well with bufio.Reader() to split the commas during the read CSV files process.
