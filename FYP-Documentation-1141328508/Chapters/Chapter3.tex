\subsection{Data Collection}

The project is required to work with large data sets to utilize infrastructure and processing power of GO and RUST concurrent programming language. Data collection is conducted to identify of company recruitment preferences on higher education graduates of different subjects in the UK with basic company and LEO datasets. Data collected is required to be clean and able to solve interesting problem or question. 

The characteristic of free, consent and licensed data sets acquired from UK government website provider (data.gov.uk) are as follow:

\begin{table}[H]
	\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
	\begin{tabulary}{1.0\textwidth}{|L|L|L|L|L|L}
		\hline
		{\bf No} & {\bf Name of Datasets}  						& {\bf Column } & {\bf Rows} & {\bf Size}	\\ \hline
		1.       & Longitudinal Educations Outcomes (LEO)       &  21          & 32706       & 1.8   GB		\\ \hline
		2.       & Basic Company Profile (Company)              &  55          & 3595702     & 667.5 MB		\\ \hline
		3.       & National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL)   &  35          & 1754882     & 4.2	 MB		\\ \hline
	\end{tabulary}}
	\caption{The detail of datasets obtained.}
\end{table}

The file format of all large dataset obtained are Comma Separated Values (CSV) format which the information is organized with one record as one line and each field is separated by comma (,). CSV format is used for data processing in this project because it is human readable and simple to be parse. It can be handle using PostgreSQL database and retrievable by programs.

\subsubsection{Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) dataset }

The data set focus on employment and earnings outcome of Bachelorâ€™s Degree graduate in Great Britain after five years. It contains information about students include personal characteristics, education or qualification achieved, employment and income earnings.  The data dictionary of longitudinal education outcome is created and placed in Appendix I.1.1.

\subsubsection{Basic Company dataset}

The data set possesses up-to-date basic companies information on UK register. It contains company names, annual returns filing dates, location details, account and basic information about mortgage and business changes. The data dictionary of basic company dataset is created and placed in Appendix I.1.2.

\subsubsection{National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL) dataset}

\end{figure}

As postcode data for every location on earth is unique. Company data sets possess \textbf{postcode} field in the business address, but LEO dataset do not have the \textbf{postcode} field which leads to difficulty of defining a relationship between these two datasets. Figure above show NSPL dataset serves as a linker to map \textbf{region} column from LEO data to link with \textbf{postcode} column found in company datasets.

The data set possesses current postcode for the United Kingdom. It contains information relates postcode number, location, country name, parliamentary constitution, electoral and other geographical details. The data dictionary of National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL) dataset is created and placed in Appendix I.1.3.



\subsection{Data Validation}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption[Data Validation Procedure Flowchart]{Data Validation Procedure Flowchart}
\end{figure}

Data validation is conducted to inspect the quality dimension of data sources acquire in Data Collection (Section 3.1.2) to prevent corruption, inconsistency and conflicts during importing, using and processing. It is performed to ensure the data acquired are clean and in excellent quality. 

The important steps taken on validation of data are shown in Figure 3.5. The \textbf{completeness} of datasets will be examine to assures the characteristic of data fulfill Comma Separate Values (CSV) standard and requirement. The common test performed during data completeness check are using aggregate functions such as max, min or counts. \cite{data-completeness-check}

Furthermore, the \textbf{validity} of data types in each columns are measured to prevent incompatible data types during Data Importation, Object Relational Mapping (ORM) and Data Migration. The types of data stored in each columns of obtained datasets shall be identify to describe suitable data type for Database Definition Language (DDL) during database table creation. As an example, the alphanumeric and text field are usually defined as VARCHAR and field contains only number will be declared as INTEGER.  

In addition, the \textbf{uniqueness} of records will be verify to discover wasteful and duplication of data. The data redundancy indicates same piece of data are exist in multiple place. \cite{data-redundancy-definition} This condition will results in waste of space, data inconsistency and violates data integrity. If the duplication of data is discovered, database normalization will be performed to eliminate the duplication of records. 

Last but not least, the \textbf{consistency} of data will be analyze to ensure datasets obtained are conform to specific standards and meet requirements. The data consistency check shall be performed during data preparation to inspect discover missing, corrupted or invalid data in record. The conformity and consistency of data in specific column should be handled in wariness to prevent affect the outcomes and efficiency of data processing. If the data is found inconsistent, Data Cleaning and Data Importation will be conducted to fix the defects discovered in the datasets.

	\rule{35em}{0.5pt}
	\caption[Data Encoding Architecture Diagram]{Data Encoding Architecture Diagram}
\end{figure} 

Data encoding is a conversion of records or fields into specialized format for efficient transformation, importation and migration. \cite{data-encoding-definition} Figure 3.14 shows an architecture diagram that describe a high-level view of data encoding flow. The sed stream editor provide powerful feature to perform editing operations coming from a file to remove inconsistency data. \cite{sed-usage} 

The stream editor allow developer to make editing decisions by calling the commands on terminal. It consumes the dirty raw data as input file and perform text substitution line-by-line based on the text patterns of regular expressions provided in the commands. Ultimately, the encoded file will be output and store into the same directory. 

\section{Data Transformation}

\subsection{Phase 2 Architectural Diagram}

	\caption[Data Transformation Architectural Diagram]{Data Transformation Architectural Diagram}
\end{figure} 


Data transformation is the process of converting one format to another by extracting from source application into data warehouse. \cite{data-transformation-definition} 

Figure 3.15 shows the architectural diagram of data transformation process in this project. After the data inconsistency is eliminated with data encoding (performed in Section 3.3), the data in CSV format is extracted and import into PostgreSQL database with PL/pgSQL commands in terminal environment.

	\caption[Data Retrieval with ORM Deployment Diagram]{Data Retrieval with ORM Deployment Diagram}
	\end{figure}


Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique to manipulate data from database with object-oriented paradigm. The data retrieve from CSV data sources and PostgreSQL database will be convert into object model to ease the manipulation of data in discipline manner. \cite{orm-introduction} The approach increase usability, flexibility and improve data handling for Data Cleaning and Data Migration.

Figure 3.16 shows the ORM deployment diagram that provide graphic representation of mapping between object and data with mapping program written in Go and Rust programming language. In this project, we will construct our own ORM tools tool for data retrieval from CSV file and PostgreSQL database with the assistance of CSV package driver, PostgreSQL driver and built-in SQL library from respective language. 

All the rows of data will be retrieved from PostgreSQL database and CSV file with Go and Rust's ORM to conduct performance comparison between sequential and concurrent execution and concurrent programming languages' expressive power. The results will be recorded and compared. 

\section{Data Cleaning}

\subsection{Introduction}

Data cleaning is the action of detecting and removing missing, incomplete and data redundancy within database. \cite{data-cleaning-definition} The inconsistencies and incorrect records will be detected in the datasets obtained from the secondary sources because we have lack of control over the data quality. 

Data redundancy occurs within a data storage when same piece of data exists in two separate places or two different fields within a single database. Database without normalization will cause updation, deletion and insertion anomalies. The table below is used to understand these the impact of these anomalies on causing data inconsistencies. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{FYP2/Chapter3/denormalization-example.png}
	\rule{35em}{0.5pt}
	\caption[Student table without normalization]{Student table without normalization}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1.5ex]
	
	\item \textbf{Insertion anomaly.} If student don't enroll any subject and \textbf{subject} is a mandatory field, the records cannot be insert into the database without the presence of other attributes or columns. 
	\item \textbf{Deletion anomaly.} If specific student willing to drop a subject, the entire records are forced to delete. As a result, certain attributes or part of the records are lost due to deletion of specific attributes without awareness which leads to missing data.
	\item \textbf{Updation anomaly.} To update student address in the table, the entire \textbf{address} column are required to be updated. If the duplicate records in the database are partially updated, it will leads to data inconsistency. 
	
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, \textbf{database normalization} and \textbf{data standardization} is conducted to improve the quality and reliability of the datasets.

\subsection{Database Normalization}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Data normalization is conducted to eliminate data redundancy and improve data integrity. The mentioned method is an approach to remove all the data anomalies and recover the database into consistent state. \cite{normalization-benefits} Normalization is a multi-step approach and require rules to organize data into tabular forms and define relationships among them. The normalization rules and description are listed as follow: 

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1.5ex]
	
	\item \textbf{First Normal Form (1NF).} The rule required to eliminate repeating groups, identify primary key and discover \textbf{partial dependencies} or \textbf{transitive dependencies} among column by determine the determinant of the records. 
	\item \textbf{Second Normal Form (2NF).} The rule required to create new table with primary key assigned for \textbf{partial dependencies} elimination. 
	\item \textbf{Third Normal Form (3NF).} The rule required to create new table with primary key assigned for transitive dependencies elimination. 
	
\end{enumerate}

Relational database design is conducted to define entities, attributes, relationships and keys to fulfill normalization rules on eliminating data redundancy. The information contains in raw data are divided and separated into specific table and establish relationship among them to form an organized database. Ultimately, naming conventions and standards are used to form table to increase the usability and maintainability of database.

	\caption[Company Data Cleaning Parser Deployment Diagram]{Company Data Cleaning Parser Deployment Diagram}
\end{figure} 

The figure 3.18 shows the deployment diagram of company data cleaning parser. 

The cleaning parser is written with Go program language that consume encoded company raw data (performed in Section 3.3) as input and make execution decisions to eliminate NULL values and perform data standardization to repair missing and incorrect data. Afterwards, the cleaned data will be stored into PostgreSQL database await to be processed. The program work similarly as ORM (mentioned in Section 3.5) by utilizing go-csv driver to retrieve data from CSV files and lib/pq or database/sql driver to establish connection and perform transaction with the PostgreSQL database. 

\section{Database Tuning}

\subsection{Phase 2 Database Tuning Flowchart}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\rule{35em}{0.5pt}
	\caption[Database Tuning Flowchart]{Database Tuning Flowchart}
\end{figure} 

Database tuning is a process of configure PostgreSQL database's environment to optimize performance by increase throughput and decrease response time. The approach required to open PostgreSQL database configuration file with root access in Linux Operating System environment. The configuration made and reason to perform are describe as follow: 

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1.5ex]
	
	\item \textbf{Max Connection.} The number max connection of PostgreSQL database is modified to allow more \textit{Goroutines} from Go program to establish database connection concurrently and perform parallelize transaction. This modification helps increase performance on Data Cleaning and Data Migration in this project. If the connection pool is not modified, the database system will display FATAL error and terminate the process immediately. 
	\item \textbf{Shared Buffer.} The parameter of shared memory buffer shall be modified as 25 percents of memory in our systems. Increase the amount of memory PostgreSQL database uses for shared memory buffers allow the database to handle extra workloads. 
	\item \textbf{Shared Memory.} The maximum size of shared memory segment shall be modified to allow \textit{Goroutines} or \textit{threads} access to PostgreSQL database simultaneously for better data passing and avoid redundant copies. This configuration parameter determine dedicated memory for PostgreSQL to caching data and increase the space for threads to communicate with the database. The parameter shall be modify with Bytes(B). 
	
\end{enumerate}

Ultimately, restart of PostgreSQL database is required to update the changes and modifications. 

\section{Data Migration} 

Data migration is the process of transferring data within storage system for database migration. \cite{data-migration-definition} Data migration is extremely challenging as we need to take care of performance issues, data integrity, data consistency and prevent data corruption. The data should be protect carefully and prevent missing during the migration process. 

\begin{landscape}
	\subsection{Phase 2 Data Migration Deployment Diagram} 
	\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=1.4\textwidth]{FYP2/Chapter3/FYP2-data-migration-deployment.png}
		\rule{35em}{0.5pt}
		\caption[Data Migration Deployment Diagram]{Data Migration Deployment Diagram}
	\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

Figure 3.20 shows the deployment diagram of data migration process. 

The normalized table in all database are created with PL/pgSQL DDL scripts. Once the creation of table is successful, the data migration of education database is performed with PL/pgSQL DML script running in terminal environment. The mentioned database is migrated with script because it only contains 30000+ rows and its lightweight to be process with queries. 

Afterwards, the postcode and company database are migrated from legacy storage to new storage with the execution of scripts and Go program as shown in Figure 3.23. Both company and postcode data are migrated with Go program because it contains more than 4 millions rows in total and its difficult to handle with queries. The unique data is extracted from legacy storage and stored into the normalized table in new storage. 

The postcode migration program is developed with \textbf{Channel Synchronization} concepts to perform data migration execution across goroutines to form an concurrent execution. The synchronization primitives of Go programming language is used to perform communication between threads within channel in mutual exclusion locks.

Other than that, the company migration program is developed with \textbf{Semaphore} concepts to apply control access of 400,000 \textit{Goroutines} on common resource provided by PostgreSQL database and operating system environment. The concurrency of data migration execution in this program are controlled and limited to prevent race condition. These Goroutines are required to communicate with each other to utilized 299 open connection with PostgreSQL database on migrating 3.5 millions of data with specific resource provided. 

The migration program is written with Go programming language with the inclusion of database/sql driver to establish connection and lib/pq driver to perform transaction with PostgreSQL database. All the migration process does not modify the source data in legacy storage to serve as backup for in case of emergence. In addition, the changes of migration can be easily tracked for verification purposes. Ultimately, the migration duration is recorded and measured.
